# Movies-ETL
## Module 8: Extract, Transform, Load 
I work for Amazing Prime Video that is a platform for streaming movies and TV shows. The goal for Amazing Prime is to develop an algorithm to determine which low budget movies will become successful. The company will hold a hackathon and invite programers to develop the algorithm.  I am responsible for creating the files that will be used in a hackathon.
## Lesson 1: Overview of the ETL Process
Lesson 1 was an overview the Extract, Transform, and Load process. No exercises were completed in this lesson.
## Lesson 2: Extract the Data
I created my GitHub repository and downloaded a JSON file containing movie information. I loaded the JSON file into a list of dictionaries instead of a dataframe. Approximately 7,311 records were pulled in. (I have a feeling that a lot of cleaning is going to be performed on the data.) Additionally, I extracted a large zip file from Kaggle and a smaller file on ratings to help with our analysis.
Lesson 3: Transform: Clean Individual Datasets
Oh my goodness; this was a rough section.  It contained a lot of information and steps.  The hardest part was cleaning the Wikipedia dataset.  That took several hours.  I learned about lambda functions and regular expressions.  Both came in very handy.  I also cleaned the Kaggle and Ratings datasets, which were easier.   
Lesson 4:  Transform:  Merge Datasets
In this lesson, I cleaned and merged the Wikipedia and Kaggle datasets and then merged into the movies dataframe.  In the second exercise, I merged cleaned and merged the rating dataset into the movies dataframe.
