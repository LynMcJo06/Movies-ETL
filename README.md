# Movies-ETL
## Module 8: Extract, Transform, Load 
I work for Amazing Prime Video that is a platform for streaming movies and TV shows. The goal for Amazing Prime is to develop an algorithm to determine which low budget movies will become successful. The company will hold a hackathon and invite programers to develop the algorithm.  I am responsible for creating the files that will be used in a hackathon.
## Lesson 1: Overview of the ETL Process
Lesson 1 was an overview the Extract, Transform, and Load process. No exercises were completed in this lesson.
## Lesson 2: Extract the Data
I created my GitHub repository and downloaded a JSON file containing movie information. I loaded the JSON file into a list of dictionaries instead of a dataframe. Approximately 7,311 records were pulled in. (I have a feeling that a lot of cleaning is going to be performed on the data.) Additionally, I extracted a large zip file from Kaggle and a smaller file on ratings to help with our analysis.
Lesson 3: Transform: Clean Individual Datasets.
